## FAQ

#### What does this software do?

This software has the utility of a calendar, notekeeper and reminder app that is cross-compatible between different Desktop platforms.


#### Why Flutter

I used Flutter not necessarily because it can also build for mobile because I can't really test for those platforms well (No Android phone or MacOS) but because it's easily compatible with desktop platforms like Windows and Linux, which is important because I switch on the daily between those two.
